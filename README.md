# My-C-learning-process

-I saved each of the topics I learned while learning the C language as a project. 


-The code of each project is in the "main.c" file.


-There are 59 lessons in total. 


-Apart from the code file that I wrote while teaching the subject I learned and took notes in it, 
at the end of the lesson, I made examples of what I learned in a different project file 
and saved them in that lesson file.
